# ServiceFabric.IoTSample

An example of how to use Service Fabric to process the data from IoT Hub. This project is based on .Net core.
Since new applications will be built on .Net core, and since switching from WindowsAzure to Microsoft.Azure NuGet packages will be recommended, 
this could be an example of how to leverage Microsoft.Azure NuGet packages to have microservices oriented architecture with Service Fabric and .NET core.

This project used [this](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/service-fabric-dotnet-iot/) project as a baseline and idea, and is a lightweight
version that demonstrates how to use new packages to achieve the same core functionality.
